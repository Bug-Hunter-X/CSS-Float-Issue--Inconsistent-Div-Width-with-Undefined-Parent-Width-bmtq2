The following CSS code results in unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This code intends to make two divs sit side by side, each occupying 50% of the parent container's width. However, if the parent container does not have a defined width, the divs might not behave as expected due to the default behavior of `float`.

The issue arises because the floating elements will only take up the space of their content. If the content is less than 50% of the available width, the parent container will collapse to the minimum size necessary to contain the floats.  This means the divs will not stretch to fill the parent.

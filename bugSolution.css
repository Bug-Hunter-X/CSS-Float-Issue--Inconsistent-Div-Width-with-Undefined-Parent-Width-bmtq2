The solution uses flexbox to achieve the desired layout:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Ensures padding and border are included in the width */
}

.parent {
  display: flex;
}
```

This code uses `display: flex` on the parent container which solves the issue without relying on `float` and explicitly setting the parent's width.  Each div will automatically occupy 50% of the parent's available width.
